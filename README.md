# olivierlacan/feedback

This is a quick little ask-me-anything type of repository.

This repository is unashamedly inspired by [holman/feedback](https://github.com/holman/feedback). I'm always very curious about other people and companies work, so if you have any questions or feedback regarding what I've written or produced, I'd love to hear it. Of course, questions about [Envy Labs](https://github.com/envylabs) and [Code School](https://github.com/codeschool) are welcome. For instance if you're curious about our work philosophy, our "culture", what technology or hardware we use, who gets up insanely early in the morning, go nuts. I'll try to be as honest as I can.

If you have any technical problems with Code School, your best bet is to [ask Code School Support directly](https://codeschool.com/support). They're much better and faster at answering questions than I am.

### Ask a question

Asking a question is as easy as
[creating a new issue](https://github.com/olivierlacan/feedback/issues/new) on this
project.

I'll try to answer it as soon as I can get to it. Once I answer I'll close the
issue just so I know what I've covered, but don't worry â€” if you have any further
questions just respond in the thread and I'll get back to you soon. Feel free to
ask a question on any old issue too, even if you didn't create it.

### Read some questions

Check out the [Closed Issues](https://github.com/olivierlacan/feedback/issues?sort=created&direction=desc&state=closed&page=1)
filter on this repository to browse questions I've answered in the past. I try
to use this as an email replacement that everyone can see, so feel free to dig
into some of the older threads.
